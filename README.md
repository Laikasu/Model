# iPSF Simulation  

## Overview  
**iPSF Simulation** is a tool designed for simulating the **Interferometric Point Spread Function (iPSF)** that you observe in interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy. It enables researchers and engineers to enter experimental parameters to see how they affect the iPSF.

## Features  
- Simulate PSF and iPSF with configurable parameters
- Efficient computational methods for high-speed simulations

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Laikasu/ipsf-simulation.git
cd ./iPSF-Simulation
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
